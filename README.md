# DigHub 

> For everyones dig projects

Aimed at pet owners with pet's that like to dig and anyone that likes to dig. You can record the dig projetcts progression and have a catalogue
of all previous dig projects and all previous logged progress. 

## Features

1. Personal profiles
2. Repositories 
3. log -> commit -> pull request
4. branches?

Possibly use real git to keep track of repos and version control. Might be overkill for the required features

### Flow of a projects

1. User creates repo
2. "log" and update (stash it automatically)
3. commit the "log" (pushes update to repo)
4. Others who have contributed to the project
    * Fork project
